# test-interface

This project is made of the application skeleton for a typical [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) web app.
It's just a study about github API and angularJs.

## Why?

Just for fun and for test all the opzions available on the API (https://developer.github.com/v3/) via angularJS.

### How?

In order to call github API via angularJs I've included Michael's github.js (https://github.com/michael/github).
I've to write some custom directives and some automated tests
